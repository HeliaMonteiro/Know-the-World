## :woman_technologist: Planning & Problem Solving


  I did start taking notes what I need to do and breaking it down into small steps.
  I've used Trello to planning my tasks by priority and separate it by to do, doing 
  and done to organise the creative process and achieve MVP with the result I was looking for.
  In the first two days I've focused on get the MVP workink and after that I started to work in the style.
  I've choosen the color pellete and created a kind of logo as well, I made all the style based on ideas I drew on my whitheboard.
