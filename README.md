:woman_technologist: Planning & Problem Solving


    I did start taking notes what I need to do and breaking it down into small steps.
    I've used Trello to planning my tasks by priority and separate it by to do, doing 
    and done to organise the creative process and achieve the result I was looking for.

    I'm using Sinatra, Ruby, HTML, DB and CSS.
